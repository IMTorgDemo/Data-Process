R has simple testing tools that simulate functionality found in other languages.  While these tools are comparatively weaker, it is expected that you use typical R code to set-up the environment.

This example code comes from the R Packages reference manual, chapter [Testing](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html).  It makes use of the [testthat](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat) package.



```{r}
# install.packages('testthat')
library(testthat)
library(stringr)
context("String length")

test_that("str_length is number of characters", {
  expect_equal(str_length("a"), 1)
  expect_equal(str_length("ab"), 2)
  expect_equal(str_length("abc"), 3)
})

test_that("str_length of factor is length of level", {
  expect_equal(str_length(factor("a")), 1)
  expect_equal(str_length(factor("ab")), 2)
  expect_equal(str_length(factor("abc")), 3)
})

test_that("str_length of missing is missing", {
  expect_equal(str_length(NA), NA_integer_)
  expect_equal(str_length(c(NA, 1)), c(NA, 1))
  expect_equal(str_length("NA"), 2)
})
```
