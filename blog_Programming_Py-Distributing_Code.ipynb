Each solution must be thoughtfully analyzed for strengths and weaknesses, especially from the perspective of security.  The decisons you make are largely based on the language employed to create the solution.  This post will describe steps taken in distributing a Python solution."

    "Simple python scripts are a terrific approach to getting work done, quickly.  However, in more professional environments, the ease of use can make distribution tricky.  Python is a 'bytecode interpreted language' so that it is disseminated as scripts.  Compilation is unique to the machine that runs the code.  Providing users with the bytecode (.pyc) is possible, but must be run, by the python interpreter, on the same version of virutal machine.\n",
