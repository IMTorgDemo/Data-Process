    "Static Site Generators are quite popular replacements for traditional server-based methods of delivering HTML.  One of the most popular is Hugo because of its compilation speed.  Combining Hugo with Jupyter notebooks, and other tools, can provide for a speedy workflow for pushing your ideas to the web, books (online or pdf), and more.  This post will discuss why you may want to do this and provides tools for doing it."

    "## Creating and Sharing Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating and publishing content is an investment.  Even poorly-created content still takes time to put text to file and file to web.  I've seen many people get started with blogging only to quit after getting the site running.  They refine the site styling to a remarkable degree, then the posts end after two weeks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Which begs the question: why blog?  A way to to have an online presence or to build a brand?  Rubbish.  No one will go to your site because you're nobody.  And why should they - you don't care about them, either.  Funny enough, people go to [Paul Graham's blog](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html), and I don't think he spent 10 minutes on his CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another perspective is that you want to share ideas, with yourself, and, sometimes, others.  The content I create is a knowledge base.  I've learned a great deal of things.  I want to access, reference, and update those things as I refine skills and knowledge.  If someone asks me a question and I'm feeling selfish with my time, then I can point them to a post: it is researched, organized, and documented at times that I was interested in a topic.  I can't remember everything all of the time!\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I'm easily distracted by new ideas.  Creating content adds a little more time to the current work I'm doing, but it helps drive new ideas toward longer-term interests and goals.  The ideas are incorporated into a previous world view that is then updated.  Strategically, I can look over this past work and use it in future projects.  This is not so much to make things easier, in the future, as it is to see how perspectives change with the addition of new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better yet - prove to yourself that you understand some material.  You don't know something until you can teach to others, or teach it, simply... to a child... something like that.  This post is about creating this new habit, and sticking to it by not wasting your time with the boring stuff.\n"

    "## An Effective Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I've tried multiple workflows and the following is by far the fastest and most effective.  Two key components are Jupyter nobooks and Hugo Static Site Generator (SSG).  The key components are separating your content (Jupyter) from the delivery (Hugo), and ensuring you use simple scripts for the plumbing in your workflow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Docker -> Jupyter -> Markdown -> Hugo -> SSG / Book (online) / Book (pdf) -> github pages\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter allows you to succinctly place all of your content, together, even if it doesn't concern programming.  That way you can easily move to some new method of dissemination if SSG doesn't serve your purpose.  If you make programming a topic in your content, you are really helping yourself.  The code and output are maintained, together, and can easily be update, in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using simple scripts (bash or python files) to automate your work ensures that plumbing can be created easily and quickly modified when you improve your process or make major changes to it.  This might seem like more overhead, and it is, in the short-term.  But, having the ability to direct your content to, and reuse it in, different sources, such as blog post, book, or a journal format, is incredibly powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed process\n",
    "\n",
    "To go into more detail, I start with a docker image with Jupyter installed.  The docker container shares volumes with the local space for saving .ipynb files.  These are maintained in a github repo, so all content is secure and easily reproducible.  The only concern is where to keep your accompanying data, which is mostly dependent on size.  An AWS S3 bucket is usually a safe bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the content is ready, it can be prepared for dissemination using a simple script.  Jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) are json.  These should be converted to markdown (.md) and placed, with dependencies (images, media, etc.), into the appropriate Hugo directory structure.  A final review can be performed by running Hugo locally.  Changes can be made to the markdown files, the Hugo public directory (converted HTML SSG files), is commited and pushed to github repo for publication on github pages.  All of this can be done in less than 30 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some similar, but less flexible, workflows.  If you are using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and are only concerned with data science content using R or Python, then you can use [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).  This is a great workflow and really saves the user much time.  However, both RStudio and blogdown are opinionated and large.  If you want to change something, then you will either have to do it their way (if the option is present), or you will have to dig knee-deep into code (probably for several days) to modify things to how you want them.  This lack of control does not suite me."

    "There are many choices for distributing content to the web, but I find most are time-consuming in either overhead, process, or customization.  This is not the case with Jupyter and Hugo.  Overhead is only a few hours for set-up and getting accustomed to styling.  The process only takes a two commands and a localhost review.  Customization cannot be any easier because of the simplicity of the pipeline and scripts.  If fewer languages or less flexibility is acceptable, than RStudio and blogdown may be preferable, but this may be regretful, later."
