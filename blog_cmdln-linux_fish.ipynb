    "The Linux terminal (typically implemented with the Bourne Again Shell Script, BASH) can be intimidating for beginners and annoying for experienced programmers.  But, it is a necessity for most users of Linux; and, in many situations, it can also be a huge productivity enhancer over graphical interfaces.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fish is a commandline tool that is a great complement to BASH.  It is highly configureable and provides nice features such as syntax coloring and `TAB` command completion, out-of-the-box.  For this tutorial, we will use a quick docker set-up with the smallest, but still capable, Linux image (bitnami/minideb).  Then, we will install fish and try some of the most common Linux commands.  Fish isn't necessary for most of these bash commands; however, it can make your life a little easier while flying through various directories working on your next project.\n",
